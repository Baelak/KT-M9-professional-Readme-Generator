## Features
One useful feature of the project is the cross-referencing table that allow the user to associate a product with a tag and track the product with the associated tag in the Product-Tag table. Another useful feature is the cascade delete option where if you delete a category it also delete an associated product if it is the only thing that is under that category, which cleans up our data and keeps the data integrity.
